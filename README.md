---

## Development

- Install all dependencies & the [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/):

  ```sh
  npm install
  npm install netlify-cli -g
  ```

- Create or connect to your Netlify project by running through the Netlify `init` script:

  ```sh
  netlify init
  ```

- Add your Supabase and session environment variables to a `.env` file like [`.env.sample`](./.env.sample) file or through the Netlify project dashboard at [https://app.netlify.com/](https://app.netlify.com/) Site settings/Build & deploy/Environment:

  ```
  SUPABASE_URL=""
  SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=""
  SESSION_SECRET=""
  ```

> There is more information about the Supabase variables [in the Database section below](#database). The initial `create-remix` command will [create the `SESSION_SECRET` variable](https://github.com/netlify-templates/kpop-stack/blob/fd68e4de2f4034328481c9b26fa67e298ef20204/remix.init/index.js#L47) which is a random string of 16 characters, so feel free to just set a random 16 chars if not running `remix-create`.

  <summary>Environment Variable list in project dashboard.</summary>

![screenshot of env vars in Netlify UI](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzkoxrsdj/image/upload/v1649265873/CleanShot_2022-04-06_at_13.23.38_2x_sh3hoy.jpg)

  </details>

- Start dev server:

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

### Running Locally

Running `npm run dev` will also trigger the Netlify local development environment which will pull in all the [environment variables](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/environment-variables/#declare-variables) of your Netlify project. You can learn more about this project's Supabase environment variables in [the Database section below](#database). With Netlify dev you can also:

- test functions
- test redirects
- share a live session via url with `netlify dev --live`
- [and more](https://cli.netlify.com/netlify-dev/) :)

### Relevant code:

This is a pretty simple note-taking app, but it's a good example of how you can build a full stack app with Remix and Supabase. The main functionality is creating users, logging in and out, and creating and deleting notes.

- creating users, and logging in and out [./app/models/user.server.ts](./app/models/user.server.ts)
- user sessions, and verifying them [./app/session.server.ts](./app/session.server.ts)
- creating, and deleting notes [./app/models/note.server.ts](./app/models/note.server.ts)

---

## Database

This project uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for data storage and user authentication.

### Environment Variables

You will need these 2 environment variables to connect to your Supabase instance:

- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`:

  Found in Settings/API/Project API keys
  <details><summary> See screenshot</summary>
    
    ![supabase anon key location](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzkoxrsdj/image/upload/v1649193447/Screen_Shot_2022-04-05_at_5.15.45_PM_ipdgcc.jpg)

  </details>

- `SUPABASE_URL`:

  Found in Settings/API/Configuration/URL
  <details><summary> See screenshot</summary>
    
    ![supabase url location](https://res.cloudinary.com/dzkoxrsdj/image/upload/v1649193610/Screen_Shot_2022-04-05_at_5.18.12_PM_sj7mj8.jpg)

  </details>

You can add your environment variables to an `.env` file (like shown in the sample [`.env.sample`](./.env.sample)) which will not be committed publicly because it is added to the `.gitignore` file. Or you can add it to your Netlify project environment variables (Site settings/Build & deploy/Environment) as shown in the [Development section](#development) so that they can be [easily shared with teammates](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/12/09/use-access-and-share-environment-variables-on-netlify).

<details>
<summary>Database creation</summary>

- You can sign up with Supabase with your GitHub credentials
- Create a new project on the 'Project' page

  ![CleanShot 2022-03-31 at 11 54 36](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8431042/161098029-b2651160-29c5-42fc-a149-a12cc4f2b339.png)

- Next you will need to name the database and makes sure to save the password you select, then you will want to choose a region closes to you

  ![CleanShot 2022-03-31 at 11 55 47](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8431042/161098251-8d73f0ab-c9e7-4a78-921e-1dcf65d9ad1c.png)

- It will take some time for the project to be fully scaffold so you will need to wait before the next steps.

</details>

<details>
<summary>SQL Queries</summary>

- In your Supabase project dashboard, you can find the SQL Editor here

  ![CleanShot 2022-03-31 at 11 57 16](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8431042/161098529-9f6fc807-a413-49af-bfc1-1c16a2c4ae2f.png)

- Select "New Query"

  ![CleanShot 2022-03-31 at 11 59 29](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8431042/161098865-7c790cbc-db76-45b3-aa75-270af70038ae.png)

- Here are the SQL queries used in the K-pop Stack

  ```sql
  -- Create public profile table that references our auth.user
  create table public.profiles (
    id uuid references auth.users not null,
    created_at timestamptz not null default current_timestamp,
    email varchar not null,

    primary key (id)
  );

  -- Create public notes table
  create table public.notes (
    id uuid not null default uuid_generate_v4(),
    title text,
    body text,
    created_at timestamp default current_timestamp,
    updated_at timestamp default current_timestamp,
    profile_id uuid references public.profiles not null,

    primary key (id)
  );

  -- inserts a row into public.users
  create or replace function public.handle_new_user()
  returns trigger
  language plpgsql
  security definer set search_path = public
  as $$
  begin
    insert into public.profiles (id, email)
    values (new.id, new.email);
    return new;
  end;
  $$;

  -- trigger the function every time a user is created
  drop trigger if exists on_auth_user_created on auth.user;
  create trigger on_auth_user_created
    after insert on auth.users
    for each row execute procedure public.handle_new_user();
  ```

- You can copy these over to the SQL Editor and click the 'Run' button

  ![CleanShot 2022-03-31 at 12 04 31](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8431042/161099881-79315a5f-af33-44fc-aee4-daf9a506f23f.png)

- Lastly, you will need to go to 'Authentication and Settings', and switch off "Enable email confirmations" for the project

## Deployment

This stack has the Netlify [configuration file (netlify.toml)](./netlify.toml) that contains all the information needed to deploy your project to Netlify's [edge nodes](https://www.netlify.com/products/edge).

Want to deploy immediately? Click this button

[![Deploy to Netlify Button](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/netlify-templates/nextjs-toolbox)

Clicking this button will start the setup for a new project and deployment.

### Deploy from the Command Line

Clone this repo with the `git clone` command. Then install the [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) tool and run `netlify init`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/netlify-templates/kpop-stack

npm install netlify-cli -g # to install the Netlify CLI tool globally

netlify init # initialize a new Netlify project & deploy
```

### CI/CD

Using the 'Deploy to Netlify' button or the `init` process will also set up continuous deployment for your project so that a new build will be triggered & deployed when you push code to the repo (you can change this from your project dashboard: Site Settings/Build & deploy/Continuous Deployment).

You can also use `netlify deploy` or `netlify deploy --prod` to manually deploy then `netlify open` to open your project dashboard.

> ðŸ’¡ If you don't use `--prod` on the deploy command you will deploy a preview of your application with a link to share with teammates to see the site deployed without deploying to production

---

## Testing

### Cypress

We have set up the basic configuration files for [Cypress](https://go.cypress.io/) End-to-End tests in this project. You'll find those in the `cypress` directory. As you make changes, add to an existing file or create a new file in the `cypress/integrations` directory to test your changes.

We use [`@testing-library/cypress`](https://testing-library.com/cypress) for selecting elements on the page semantically.

To run these tests in development, run `npm run e2e-test` which will start the dev server for the app as well as the Cypress client.

To other example of Cypress tests specifically on Remix stacks, check out the `cypress` directory in the [Remix Grunge Stack example](https://github.com/remix-run/grunge-stack/tree/main/cypress).

### Type Checking

This project uses TypeScript. It's recommended to get TypeScript set up for your editor to get a really great in-editor experience with type checking and auto-complete. To run type checking across the whole project, run `npm run typecheck`.

### Linting

This project uses ESLint for linting. That is configured in `.eslintrc.js`.

### Formatting

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for auto-formatting in this project. It's recommended to install an editor plugin (like the [VSCode Prettier plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)) to get auto-formatting on save. There's also a `npm run format` script you can run to format all files in the project.
